                <h2>APPERANCE:</h2>
                    <h3>The Man in Agony is a tall, slender figure with a pale, almost white-gray skin, giving it an otherworldly,<br>
                    spectral apperance. Its face is gaunt and sunken, with a voided-like hollow eyes Tears flow continuously<br>
                    down in his face, an eternal cascade of sorrow, his expression remains frozen in deep mourning, haunting<br>
                    image of grief.<br>
                <br>
                        The Man in Agony dressed in a stark black suit perfectly tailored. Atop its head rests a black fedora<br>
                        with a thin white band.

                <h2>ABILITIES:</h2>
                    <h3>The Man in Agony possesses the terrifying ability to project his overwhelming grief into others, forcing<br>
                    them to experience the depth of his sorrow. His presence alone can drive people to the brink of insanity<br>
                    , filling their minds with unbearable despair. Victims of this ability often feeel a crushing weight of<br>
                    of sorrow, leading to intense nausea, splitting headaches, and uncontrollable vomitting of a thick, black<br>
                    liquid.<br>
                <br>
                        As the effects worsen, the grief becomes suffocating, and in the most extreme cases, it can be fatal,<br>
                        slowly draining the will to live from the affected. His mere proximity is ehough to send even the strongest<br>
                        minds spiraling into madness.

                <h2>ORIGINS:</h2>
                    <h3>The origins of The Man in Agony are shrouded in mystery, with several theories attempting to explain his existence.<br>
                    One prevalent belief is that he is the ghost of a man who experienced a tragic and profound loss. According to this theory,<br>
                    he is doomed to wander endlessly in search of peace, his eternal sorrow a reflection of his unresolved grief.<br>
                <br>
                        Another perspective views, The Man in Agony as a harbinger of doom, a cursed entity whose presence signals impending misfortune.<br>
                        This interpretation suggests that his existence is tied to bringing calamity to those around him, his sorrowful state acting as<br>
                        a premonition of disaster. Regardless of the theory, his unending grief defines his spectral nature and affects those who<br>
                        encounter him in powerful ways.
